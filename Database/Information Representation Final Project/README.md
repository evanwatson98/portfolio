# Information Representation Final Project
## Last Updated: 6/23/2020
For this classes final project we were tasked with creating an ERD and developing the database using MySQL. We were eventually assigned a set of information to retrieve across multiple tables within the database we created. Please not this project was to show our skills in developing and retrieving information from a MySQL database. No time was spent for the front end.
